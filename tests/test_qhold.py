"""Offline test of the 0.6.4 hold of queued actions (mpfever_bridge.script.lua: queueLocal and pacing).

In a 45-minute AI test at 4x (t1 of 2026-10-31) an action came with a margin of one step: the host's next clock moved the native
stop point on before the simulation had taken it, and the client applied it 4 steps late (a vehicle sent to its line late, then
vehicles, money and towns drifted apart). A queued action now holds the native stop point a step before its time until the
simulation's answer to its command comes.

queueLocal and pacing are taken from the real bridge file and run through lupa (Lua 5.2) on a mocked game. Cases:
  - an action queued with its answer pending: the native stop point (G.lastStopAt) stays a step before its time while the
    host's clock moves on; once answered, the stop point goes back to the barrier's;
  - with the usual margin (16 steps) the hold is past the barrier's stop point: nothing changes;
  - an answer that never comes: no longer held after 600 frames;
  - a paused action: not held this way (its own hold, G.holdAt);
  - MPFEVER_QHOLD=0: sent as before (toSim), never held.
