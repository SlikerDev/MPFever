"""Offline test of the public list service (serverlist/ServerList.cs), version 2 (MPFever 0.6, note 09): the players' own games
in the list next to the dedicated servers, and the dedicated servers' API kept as it was for the MPFever versions before 0.6.

The real MPFeverServerList.exe runs on a free port of 127.0.0.1 (--loopback: no firewall question; the announcing address is
then the one X-Forwarded-For names, as behind the list's reverse proxy). It is built first when missing or older than its
source (MSBuild found as build.bat finds it). Cases: health says v2; a dedicated server announced as before 0.6 is listed by
/api/servers with exactly the old fields; a player's game is in /api/games only, without its address unless its host shows
it; two games behind one address and port (CGNAT) are two entries; a game needs a Steam id or its address; one announce every
10 s; a game's Steam id refused from another address while it lives, taken again by its host after a restart of its
MPFever; 8 games per address; a removal.
Run: python tests/test_serverlist.py
